# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?

timely delivery is crucial because delays can lead to increased costs, lost, lost market opportunities and customer dissatisfaction.to meet deadlines, project managers can:

1.use agile methodologies for iterative progress.

2.set realistic timelines and prioritize tasks.

3.use project management tools.

4.regularly monitor progress with standup meetings and sprint reviews.

5.manage risks proactively to prevent last minute delays.


## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?

cost coontrol prevents budget overruns and ensures project profitability.strategies include :

1.define a clear budget and tracking expenses.

2.use cost estimation techniques.

3.implementing change control process to avoid scope creep.

4.regular financial audits and variance analysis.


## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

agile:

iterative, flexible, emphasizes customer feedback .

pros: faster delivery, adaptable to changeand has better risk management.

cons: requires strong team collaboration, harder to estimate final cost.

waterfall:

linear, structured, best for well defined projects.

pros: clear documentation, predictable outcome.

cons: inflexible, hard to implement changes late in the process.



## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?


agile is best for dynamic projects witn evolving requirements such as SaaS applications or mobile apps.eg a start up debelopment on AI based chatbot.

waterfall is best for projects with fixed requirements such as government contracts or compliance heavy software.eg a banking system upgrade requiring strict regulatory adherence.


## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

quality assurance maintains software reliability and  perfomance.the methods include:

test driven development(TDD)

automated and manual testing.

code reviews and continuous integration.

high standards reduce bugs, improve user satisfaction and prevent costly post launch fixes.


## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
